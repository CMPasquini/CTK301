        <p style="text-align: center;"> I am still working on improving my digital art skills, and not everything is posted here. However, here are some of the pieces I enjoy and think reflect my growth since trying a new art style. </p>
	</main>

	<div id="myCarousel" class="f-carousel">
		<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img src="RoughSpidey.png"> 
        <p class="roundedbox"> This is my first digital drawing. I understand it is rough, but I think it help shows my growth. It is supposed to be a drawing of Spider-Man's mask. </p></div>
		<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img src="RoughDeadpool.jpg">
        <p class="roundedbox"> This is my second digital drawing. This is not my best, but it was an improvement from my first piece. This is a drawing of Deadpool. </p></div>
		<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img src="Ghastly.jpg">
        <p class="roundedbox"> This was for a school project where I had to time a drawing for five minutes and stop at the time. The piece is a drawing of Ghastly from <i>Pok√©mon</i>. </p></div>
        <div class="f-carousel__slide"><img src="ClosetMonster.jpg">
        <p class="roundedbox"> This drawing features a monster I enjoy drawing. I do not have a name for it other than "Closet Monster," but I still enjoy drawing it in creepy scenarios. </p></div>
		<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img src="SpiderMan+Gwen.jpg">
        <p class="roundedbox"> This piece is supposed to be Spider-Man and Spider-Gwen swinging through the city. This piece is semi-unfinished because I chose to stop making it earlier than planned, but I got it to a stopping point where I was content with the piece. </p></div>
        <div class="f-carousel__slide"><img src="Jack_Skellington (Digital Pg).jpg">
        <p class="roundedbox"> This piece is one of my favorite digital drawings even though it looks simple. This is a drawing of Jack Skellington </p></div>
		<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img src="RoseSkull.jpg">
        <p class="roundedbox"> This piece was inspired by one of my friends who had asked me to draw him a skull with roses. </p></div>
		<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img src="Aviation Gin Remix Art (Digital Pg).jpg">
        <p class="roundedbox"> This piece was inspired by the commercial Ryan Reynolds made for his brand Aviation Gin. In the piece I replaced Reynolds with his character Deadpool. I believe this is my most well done digital work. </p></div>
