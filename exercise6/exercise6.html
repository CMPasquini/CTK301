		<p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p>
		<p>I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Do a flip!</p>
